# SwiftyAdmin ðŸš€

An example command line utility to interact with and control a server using TootSDK.

```shell
swift build && ./.build/debug/swiftyadmin get-instance -u https://the-url-of-your-server
```

Since most commands require authentication, you can first login to obtain an access token. The login command demonstrates obtaining a token without a user interface (using the command line).

```shell
swift build && ./.build/debug/swiftyadmin login -u https://the-url-of-your-server
```

## Available commands

To view the current list of commands, build the project and run the program using the `-h` option:

```
swift build && ./.build/debug/swiftyadmin -h
```

### Domain blocks

These commands require the admin:read:domain_blocks or admin:write:domain_blocks authorization scope.
